# What is Inteaea?

Inteaea is something I made because I was bored while experiencing with NotSoBot, it will run on it's own website soon--if I get money, it will also be open-source. (You can make your own versions for fun! J-just don't be a skid.

# Inteaea's Purpose?

More commands to come really for NotSoBot, some include useful ones. Who knows what is next to come?

# Inteaea Status

Inteaea is currently in it's beta, you can install it with ".t add inteaea {eval:{text:https://bit.ly/inteaeaversion }}" via the NotSoBot bot.
